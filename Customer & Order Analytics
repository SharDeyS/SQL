#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


#1.Display how many January orders were placed
SELECT COUNT(Product) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


#2.Display how many iPhone orders there were
SELECT count(PRODUCT) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID' 
AND Product = 'iPhone';


#3.Customer account numbers for all orders placed in February
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


#4.Product and price of the cheaptest product sold in January
SELECT distinct Product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;


#5.Total revenue for each product sold in Jan
SELECT Product,SUM(quantity)*price AS Total_Rev
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product;


#6.Showcase products sold in Feb at address 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, the amt sold and total revenue--
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS Total_Rev
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;


#7.Amount of customers who ordered more than 2 products at a time in Feb and average amount spent
SELECT COUNT(cust.acctnum), AVG(Quantity*price) AS Avg_Rev
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers AS cust
ON cust.order_id = FebSales.orderID
